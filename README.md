## Description
This project involves simulating a realistic workflow to refactor a previous project using Git. The goal is to practice essential version control skills, such as branching, committing, merging, and documenting changes. You'll start by setting up a GitHub repository, adding and ignoring necessary files, and then proceed to improve the project's documentation and code structure. The final steps include merging changes and pushing the updates to the remote repository, showcasing an effective use of Git in managing and enhancing project workflows.
